PDCViewer - CAN based PDC (park distance control) optical feedback
==============================================================================

Simple prove of concept to get PDC CAN signals from a car to show on LED
bargraphs.


Current Stage:
==============

At the first step the communication will be done via CAN - easy re-use of
CAN2matrix project.


Next Steps/Ideas:
=================
(M)andatory
(O)ptional
(S)tarted Implementation
(P)artly Implemented
(T)esting and Optimizing
(D)one

- (M) show distance on one bargraph (common set)
- (M) add communication channel for information to show; UART or CAN
- (O) show distances independently
